# DeepLearning
This is a hobby project for implementing the deep learning algorithm from scratching using matlab.

The helperfunc contains helper function that is used in the logistic regression function which is also fed into the neural network function.

The datasets used in this mini project are chest X ray (real life application) and Iris (for quick test)
