# DeepLearning
This is a hobby project for implementing the deep learning algorithm from scratching using matlab.

The helperfunc contains helper function that is used in the logistic regression function which is also fed into the neural network function.

The datasets used in this mini project are chest X ray, Chornic Kidney Disease and Iris (for quick test)

## Logistic Regression

A logistic regression is actually a "simplified" neural network with only one node. With the understanding of the logistic regression, it is possible to build a full fledge neural networks by "stacking" the code by creating alot of logistic regression which will build the basis of a neural network
